In order to compile this code in Arduino, you will need to install the PS2X library from Bill Porter. We have a special version for Lynxmotion available [here](https://github.com/Lynxmotion/Arduino-PS2X/raw/master/PS2X_lib.zip) (ZIP).

If you already have the PS2X library installed, please remove it first and install the version linked above.
The relevant files are usually located in your /Arduino/libraries/ folder.

Most of the settings you can configure to customize your hexapod, its gait and communication are found [here](https://github.com/Lynxmotion/3DOF-4DOF-Hex/blob/master/BotBoarduino/3%20DoF%20Ready/BotBoarduino_CH3R_PS2/Hex_Cfg.h).

The details concerning the controls are [here](https://github.com/Lynxmotion/3DOF-4DOF-Hex/blob/master/BotBoarduino/3%20DoF%20Ready/BotBoarduino_CH3R_PS2/PS2_controller.cpp).
